I had a few issues with this assignment as far as the .DS_Store file not showing up. I still hid it in the .gitignore file, but it never appeared. 

I had a little bit of a bump trying to get refreshed on git because it's been a few semesters since I've used the terminal command line, but this module definitely helped me feel more comfortable. 

I used W3schools for some mild styling help and Google Fonts for my font style. I also used the lecture videos and linked resources in the module to help me complete this assignment.
